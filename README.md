Raks Development Test API

</h1>

## **:computer: About**
This project consists of a technical test for backend development with NodeJS.

A CRUD API was built to manage user data using MySQL database.

And finally, tests were implemented using Jest.

### How has been designed 
The project was divided into simple layers of database, models and controllers:

* The controller mediates the input and output of data, communicating with the User model.
* The model manages the behavior of the data and communicates with the database, making access to the data that must be collected, recorded or updated.
* The database was structured using ORM Sequelize migrations.

App, routes and server startup configuration files were also generated.
